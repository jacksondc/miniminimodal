#Mini Mini Modal
Mini Mini Modal is a tiny JS modal with no dependencies.
Probably the tiniest; it's basically just alert() but it looks nicer.
Trigger with `mmm('message')`.

#Installation
[Download](https://github.com/jacksondc/miniminimodal/releases/tag/1.0) and include the JS (and optionally CSS) files.
